The binary executables are stored in the ./bin folder.  Two of them (ds3, universe) are from FORTRAN files written by Dima Krioukov and/or Marian Boguna.  The third (CausalSet) is the binary compiled from the C++ files written by Will Cunningham.  The shell executable named 'causet' in the parent directory demonstrates several ways to execute 'CausalSet' with the correct parameters needed to reproduce results from the 'Network Cosmology' paper.

////////////////////////////////////////////////
//The contents of the 'CausalSet' program are //
//organized in the following files in ./src   //
////////////////////////////////////////////////

===========
|Causet.cu|
===========

This contains the main method and the top-level functions used.  All variables are stored in structs held in this function and passed to functions in this file only.  Functions in other files strictly only receive the minimal number of variables needed for their execution.
The 'parseArgs' function parses command-line arguments and adjusts the initial conditions of the network accordingly.  Any invalid parameters are caught here and the program is halted before execution.
The 'initializeNetwork' function takes the structs declared in the main method.  It first allocates memory for the node list, the adjacency lists, and the adjancency matrix.  It then populates these matrices according to the initial conditions.  When completed the Network struct should possess all necessary values for analysis.
Afterward, the program studies the network which has been generated in the 'measureNetworkObservables' function.  Currently this only consists of measuring the clustering coefficients and the average clustering.
Once these tasks have completed, the network prints any requested results to file and frees the allocated memory before exiting.

===================
|NetworkCreator.cu|
===================

This contains the functions needed by the 'inializeNetwork' function described above.  Specifically, 'createNetwork' allocates memory.  Then 'generateNodes' uses the random number generator provided by 'ran2.h' to generate points of (t,theta,chi,phi) which constitute the node locations.  Finally, 'linkNodes' uses the light cone condition to link points which have a causal relationship, storing this information in the adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.

=================
|Measurements.cu|
=================

This file contains functions used to measure observables, which are called by the function 'measureNetworkObservables' described above.  Currently the clustering coefficients and average clustering are calculated in the function measureClustering, and the success ratio is calculated in the function measureSuccessRatio.

================
|Subroutines.cu|
================

This file contains numerical subroutines which are used by this program but are not exclusive to this program.  Specifically, it contains a quicksort function, a Newton-Raphson iterative solver, and a Riemann sum 1D integration function.

===============
|Operations.cu|
===============

This file contains numerical subroutines which are explicitly specific to this program.  Examples include functions used in the Newton iterative solver and coordinate transformation functions.

================
|CuResources.cu|
================

This file contains variables and functions needed to interface with the NVIDIA GPU for CUDA functions.

===============
|autocorr2.cpp|
===============

This file contains a class and several functions used to calculate the autocorrelation of a set of random variables.
